# **Technology Stack**

---

- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (main language for game logic and interactivity)
- **Frontend UI and Framework**: React or Vue for component-based UI rendering
- **Game Framework**: Impact.js for managing 2D game scenes and mechanics
    - I checked out phaser.js and pixi.js, they dont rly meet the needs of this game. A little too complicated, mainly used for 3d rendering. Impact looks alot simpler, is all in-browser, and has examples of some top-down 2D games that look like what I imagine for this game. 
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for storing player states, meter values, and progress
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive UI components, ie. button changing color on hover, icon changing on hover/click, cursor changing based on what it is hovering over
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for handling ambient sounds and audio events
- **AI/Behavior Framework**: find something for pathfinding libraries/frameworks, especially for Big Brother AI and NPC behaviors
- **Version Control**: GitHub or GitLab for code collaboration and versioning
